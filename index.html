<h1>Chess Trainer</h1>Developed by David Spira</div><p>
<div style="width:55%;float:left"> In <a href="">Behavioral Analysis</a>, the way in which we, as living beings, discriminate the environment around us is thoroughly studied and described. 

The environment is the set of stimuli around the subject, and stimulus, in this science, is understood broadly. It can mean visual input, sounds, sensations that only the individual has access to (such as thoughts), and even subtle relations between those.<p>

Frequently, strategies can be devised to make us <span style="color:red"><b>learn to discriminate stimuli</b></span> that, despite being there all the time, a person may have not, for one reason or 	another, learnt to notice and respond to. <p>	

In chess, it's usually <span style="color:red"><b>frustrating</b></span> for players to make mistakes that have nothing to do with strategy, but rather with failing to notice specific stimuli, such as, for instance, the position of the enemy bishop and its current range of attack, i.e., the tiles where he can attack.<p>

The idea of this program is to <span style="color:red"><b>train the user's eyes</b></span> in a way that it begins to see cues on the board that would otherwise go unnoticed to them.<p>

This is achieved by, first, directly showing them which tiles on the board can immediately be attacked by their opponent. The program does that by simples painting these tiles with some shade of red.<p>

Now, it wouldn't be interesting at all to make the player dependent on such assistance, and that's why the next step is for the player, after a number of matches, to manually decrease the opacity of the red, i.e., to make it more transparent, less noticeable. In Behavioral Analysis, this is a technique called Fading, and the idea is that, after a few iterations of playing several matches and decreasing further the opacity, until it reaches zero, <span style="color:red"><b>the user can "see" the colored tiles</b></span> even when the program isn't running anymore. Something that could otherwise take a long time of regular, traditional chess practice, which would of course come with a lot of frustration.<p>

The program exists in the form of an extension for Google Chrome and it runs on chess.com. <span style="color:red"><b>It only works against Bot opponents.</b></span> After developing your reading of the board with the tool, the user will be able to play against other players without needing it. Even on real non-virtual real-life boards.<p>

<h3>Who is this program for?</h3>
<p>
    <ul>

<li>Beginner and intermediate players who want to improve </li>
<li>People who make a lot of attention mistakes, such as placing a piece on a tile only to find out a second later that the enemy could capture it</li>
<li>People who struggle to learn the basics of chess</li>

</ul>

<h3>How to install it?</h3>
1) <a href="chesstrainer.zip">Download the zip file</a>, then extract the Chess trainer folder as is. <br>
2) Access the following address with Chrome: chrome://extensions/<p><img src="board3.png" style="width:400px"><p>
3) On the top right corner, click on "Developer mode"<br>
4) On the top left corner, click on "Load Unpacked", then browse to the folder extracted. Don't open the folder, just click on it once (yellow arrow) to select it then confirm (green arrow). See picture below.<p>
<img src="folder.png" style="width:1000px"><p>

5) The extension will appear on your list of extensions. Make sure it's activated (see green arrow below)<p>
<img src="folder2.png" style="width:400px"><p>

6) Now you can go to chess.com, and start a match "vs. Computer". Choose any bot, then you will see the buttons on the bottom left corner.

<p>

<h3>How to use it?</h3>

After installing the extension, by entering a room to play against a Bot (vs Computer), you will see on the left bottom corner two buttons that aren't there usually.
<p>
<img src="board1.png" style="width:40%">
<p>
Click on the "Activate trainer" button. You will see an instruction message on the top part of the screen. You have to click Ok if you're playing with the white pieces, and Cancel if you're with the black ones.
<p> The program will now paint all the tiles that your opponent can immediately attack, and the color it will use will depend on the value on the field below.<p>

<img src="board2.png">
<p>
The number is the opacity. Setting it to 0 will make the tiles go back to normal, i.e., no overlay at all. Setting it to a high value will have them painted with a strong, very visible red. You can change the number and click "Set" during the match if you want to update the color.
<p>



<h3>Is this a cheating tool?</h3>

<p>No. While the highlighting of tiles will help you make less mistakes and, consequently, play better, it won't work against other players, only against chess.com's Bots. The idea is that, by following the path of playing many games with it and every now and then reducing the opacity further, you will begin to see the threats on the board even when not using the tool.


<h3>Why does the board style change when I activate the tool?</h3>

<p>The style that's set up when you activate the tool is one of the styles offered by chess.com. The tool changes to this specific one because it's the one that offers the best contrast with the red-tinted tiles.


<h3>When should I decrease the opacity?</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, it's not possible to predict when is the right moment, since each person will adapt to it differently. What is certain is that your vision of the board will get sharper as you get to lower and lower opacities.<p> It is recommended to use this program everyday and decrease the opacity every week, beginning with 30%, then, after a week, 20%, then 15%, 10%, 9%, 8%, 7% and so on, until 1%.<p><p><br><br><br>Â© 2024 Chess Trainer.
